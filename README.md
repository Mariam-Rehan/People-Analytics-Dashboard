# ðŸ§  People Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

A one-page dashboard that turns HR data into a visual story â€” from employee satisfaction to attrition trends, diversity insights, and performance metrics.

After an interview for a data analytics intern position in the People Analytics department (ðŸ‘€ manifesting), I realized I hadnâ€™t really worked on anything HR-specific. So I challenged myself to change that.

This dashboard was built with love (and Power BI) to explore what it means to understand people through data.

## ðŸ“Š What's Inside

- **Engagement & Satisfaction Scores**  
- **Attrition Rate** (with term reason breakdown)  
- **Hiring Patterns**  
- **Diversity Metrics** (Gender, Race, Departments)  
- **Performance Distributions**

Everything is wrapped in a clean, structured layout â€” and built to be as actionable as it is aesthetic.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Dashboard Matters

People Analytics is about more than just dashboards â€” itâ€™s about understanding the *why* behind the numbers.  
This project was my attempt to do just that â€” to explore how hiring patterns, satisfaction levels, and demographic trends all work together to shape employee outcomes.
